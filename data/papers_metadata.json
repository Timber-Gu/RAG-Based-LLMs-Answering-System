    "abstract": "This work examines whether activating latent subspaces in language models\n(LLMs) can steer scientific code generation toward a specific programming\nlanguage. Five causal LLMs were first evaluated on scientific coding prompts to\nquantify their baseline bias among four programming languages. A static\nneuron-attribution method, perturbing the highest activated MLP weight for a\nC++ or CPP token, proved brittle and exhibited limited generalization across\nprompt styles and model scales. To address these limitations, a\ngradient-refined adaptive activation steering framework (G-ACT) was developed:\nper-prompt activation differences are clustered into a small set of steering\ndirections, and lightweight per-layer probes are trained and refined online to\nselect the appropriate steering vector. In LLaMA-3.2 3B, this approach reliably\nbiases generation towards the CPP language by increasing the average probe\nclassification accuracy by 15% and the early layers (0-6) improving the probe\nclassification accuracy by 61.5% compared to the standard ACT framework. For\nLLaMA-3.3 70B, where attention-head signals become more diffuse, targeted\ninjections at key layers still improve language selection. Although per-layer\nprobing introduces a modest inference overhead, it remains practical by\nsteering only a subset of layers and enables reproducible model behavior. These\nresults demonstrate a scalable, interpretable and efficient mechanism for\nconcept-level control for practical agentic systems.",

    "abstract": "Physics-informed deep learning has achieved remarkable progress by embedding\ngeometric priors, such as Hamiltonian symmetries and variational principles,\ninto neural networks, enabling structure-preserving models that extrapolate\nwith high accuracy. However, in systems with dissipation and holonomic\nconstraints, ubiquitous in legged locomotion and multibody robotics, the\ncanonical symplectic form becomes degenerate, undermining the very invariants\nthat guarantee stability and long-term prediction. In this work, we tackle this\nfoundational limitation by introducing Presymplectification Networks (PSNs),\nthe first framework to learn the symplectification lift via Dirac structures,\nrestoring a non-degenerate symplectic geometry by embedding constrained systems\ninto a higher-dimensional manifold. Our architecture combines a recurrent\nencoder with a flow-matching objective to learn the augmented phase-space\ndynamics end-to-end. We then attach a lightweight Symplectic Network (SympNet)\nto forecast constrained trajectories while preserving energy, momentum, and\nconstraint satisfaction. We demonstrate our method on the dynamics of the\nANYmal quadruped robot, a challenging contact-rich, multibody system. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first framework that effectively bridges the\ngap between constrained, dissipative mechanical systems and symplectic\nlearning, unlocking a whole new class of geometric machine learning models,\ngrounded in first principles yet adaptable from data.",

However, current methods isolate\nassociation and similarity analysis of drug and microbe, lacking effective\ninter-view optimization and coordinated multi-view feature fusion. In our\nstudy, a multi-view Divergence-Convergence Feature Augmentation framework for\nDrug-related Microbes Prediction (DCFA_DMP) is proposed, to better learn and\nintegrate association information and similarity information. In the divergence\nphase, DCFA_DMP strengthens the complementarity and diversity between\nheterogeneous information and similarity information by performing Adversarial\nLearning method between the association network view and different similarity\nviews, optimizing the feature space. In the convergence phase, a novel\nBidirectional Synergistic Attention Mechanism is proposed to deeply synergize\nthe complementary features between different views, achieving a deep fusion of\nthe feature space. Moreover, Transformer graph learning is alternately applied\non the drug-microbe heterogeneous graph, enabling each drug or microbe node to\nfocus on the most relevant nodes. Numerous experiments demonstrate DCFA_DMP's\nsignificant performance in predicting drug-microbe associations.

Despite large-scale success, there remain significant\nchallenges including their reliance on extensive computational and memory\nresources for pre-training on huge datasets as well as difficulties in\ntask-specific transfer learning. These limitations coupled with energy\ninefficiencies mainly arise due to the computation-intensive self-attention\nmechanism. To address these issues, we propose a novel Super-Pixel Based Patch\nPooling (SPPP) technique that generates context-aware, semantically rich, patch\nembeddings to effectively reduce the architectural complexity and improve\nefficiency. Additionally, we introduce the Light Latent Attention (LLA) module\nin our pipeline by integrating latent tokens into the attention mechanism\nallowing cross-attention operations to significantly reduce the time and space\ncomplexity of the attention module. By leveraging the data-intuitive patch\nembeddings coupled with dynamic positional encodings, our approach adaptively\nmodulates the cross-attention process to focus on informative regions while\nmaintaining the global semantic structure. This targeted attention improves\ntraining efficiency and accelerates convergence. Notably, the SPPP module is\nlightweight and can be easily integrated into existing transformer\narchitectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed architecture\nprovides significant improvements in terms of computational efficiency while\nachieving comparable results with the state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting\nits potential for energy-efficient transformers suitable for edge deployment.\n(The code is available on our GitHub repository:\nhttps://github.com/zser092/Focused-Attention-ViT).",
